# EBC Method

## Project profile
This project implements a method for identifying critical edges in complex networks, based on the extent to which these edges participate in the networkâ€™s cycle basis. It also provides a framework for analyzing the robustness of complex networks under edge-based attacks.

## Dependent environment
- **Python 3.x**
- NetworkX: Operations used to process graphs
