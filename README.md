# EBC Method

## Project profile
This project implements an edge attack method based on network cycle, which is mainly used to analyze the robustness of complex networks. The code uses NetworkX library to calculate the participation of each edge in the cycle base, and then removes the edge after sorting to analyze the robustness of the network under edge attacks.

## Dependent environment
- **Python 3.x**
- **NetworkX**：Operations used to process graphs
- **Pandas**：Used for data reading and processing
